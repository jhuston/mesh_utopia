TODO:

* decide on synthdef submission method,
  (eg. sent by clients? or already loaded on server?)
* double check the SynthDescRelay

Notable Changes:

1/8/18 james:
- file/folder reorganization
- changed mesh_startup slightly so that server IP address and port number is defined explicitly in that file.
- added swarmSaw, trigTempo, and sinChatter plus some example SynthDefs and basic patterns files.
